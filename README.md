# mvc
My custom made very basic MVC written in PHP 7

Installation guide:

1. In the first place you will need to create a database on your machine
2. Run the config/install.php file in order to create a table
3. Delete config/install.php

And that's it

If you want to visit the homepage, open ~localhost/mvc/public/home

Of course that's the most common path, you can use any path you want as long as you are opening the /public/home path
